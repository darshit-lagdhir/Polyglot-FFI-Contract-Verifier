# Language Adapter - Runtime FFI Enforcement

## Overview
Module 08 transforms static contract artifacts into runtime-enforced FFI boundaries. The Language Adapter is the operationalization layer that transforms static contract artifacts into runtime-enforced guarantees.

## Architecture

The adapter architecture consists of seven distinct layers:

1. **Contract Projection Layer**: Consumes contract artifacts and builds an internal enforcement graph.
2. **Validation Engine Core**: Executes validation graphs in dependency order.
3. **Ownership State Machine**: Tracks pointer ownership across FFI boundaries.
4. **Language Specialization Interface**: Defines abstract interfaces for language-specific adapters.
5. **Invocation Orchestrator**: Coordinates the complete enforcement lifecycle.
6. **Crash Isolation Boundary**: Captures native crashes and translates them into exceptions.
7. **Reporting & Diagnostics**: Produces structured violation reports.

## Core Components

### Data Structures
- **ValidationNode**: Represents a single validation check (clause predicate).
- **ValidationGraph**: DAG of nodes ensuring correct execution order.
- **OwnershipState**: State tracking for specific memory addresses.

### Management
- **ContractProjector**: Loads and projects contract artifacts.
- **OwnershipRegistry**: Global mapping for ownership states.
- **EnforcementContext**: Per-invocation audit trail.

### Public API
- **LanguageAdapter**: Main entry point for system coordination.

## Usage

```python
from modules.module_08_language_adapter import LanguageAdapter

# 1. Initialize adapter
adapter = LanguageAdapter()

# 2. Load contract
adapter.load_contract('path/to/contract.json')

# 3. Create enforcement context
ctx = adapter.create_enforcement_context('my_native_func')

# ... execution phases ...
```
